/**
 * The datasheets of the SCD30 sensor specify the following response times and
 * current consumption for different sampling rates:
 *
 *  SAMPLING RATE	|	RESPONSE TIME	|	CURRENT CONSUMPTION
 * 		2s					20s						19mA
 * 		15s					72s						6.5mA
 * 		30s					135s					5.6mA
 *
 * Using those points to interpolate a polynomial in Wolfram Alpha, we get the
 * following function in terms of sampling rate:
 * Response time (RT) = 12.2143 + 3.87857 * x + 0.00714286 * x^2
 *
 * For the current consumption, we interpolate the (x,y) points as (1/x, y) to get:
 * Current consumption (CC) = 4.71175 + 4.07599/x^2 + 26.5385/x
 *
 * Multiplying those functions, we have the power consumption in mC, which, for x>0,
 * has a local minimum between 4 and 5 seconds.
 * Considering also our empirical results on current consumption, we set the
 * sampling rate to 5 seconds.
 *
 * **Empirical results (sampling rate, current consumption):
 * {{2.0, 18.4}, {5.0, 9.51}, {10.0, 6.56}, {15.0, 5.94}, {30., 4.83}, {60., 4.4}, {120., 3.8}}
